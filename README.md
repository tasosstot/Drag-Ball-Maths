# Break Maths With Physics

Break Maths With Physics is an educational game developed as part of my MSc program using Unity. The title has a metaphorical meaning, where "Break Maths" refers to breaking numerical boxes using simple laws of physics. The game aims to offer a fun yet educational experience, emphasizing strategy and calculation.

## Game Overview

### Gameplay
- Spend your free time creatively by sharpening your mind!
- Swipe in any direction to throw the ball and break the numerical boxes.
- Each box has a specific number of life units, and each hit reduces a unit.
- Think strategically and calculate your shots, as boxes move closer with each throw.
- If the boxes surpass you, the game is over.

### Game Features
- **Genre**: Strategy, Endless round
- **Target Audience**: 12+ years old

### Tips
1. Angles created during shots can yield excellent results!
2. Aim for long-term strategy by destroying bricks with higher numerical values.

### Character and World
- The protagonist is in a survival fantasy world, fighting off numerical boxes.
- The goal is to achieve the highest possible score.
- The game is in 2D, with the protagonist fixed in one spot, allowing for improved shot accuracy by focusing on angles.
